# XURL is a utility that can be used to generate and retrieve short URLs when we donâ€™t want to use the original longer URLs.


## During the course of this project,<br>

1-Created a short url library with required methods.<br>
2-Implemented register method to take a long URL and return a shorter URL.<br>
3-Implemented a method to lookup the long URL by providing the short URL.<br>
4-Implemented hit count to track number of long URL lookups.<br>
5-Tested this implementation with test cases.<br>



## Scope of Work<br>
- Create a concrete class which implements a short URL interface class provided. It contains all the methods that can be used to create long URL to short URL mappings.<br>
- Implement a method to take a long URL as input, generate a random 9 character short URL and return it. Also maintain this mapping using a hash map for quick retrieval.<br>
- Implement a method to take a long URL and a custom short URL as input and register that mapping. <br>
- Error handling to make sure each long URL maps to only one short URL and vice versa.<br>
- Implement a method to lookup short URL for a given long URL, from the mapping created.<br>
- Implement a method to delete the mapping based on a long URL.<br>
- Implement a counter to keep track of the hit count for each long URL - which tells us how many times a particular long URL has been looked up.<br>
- Test these methods using test cases.<br>
